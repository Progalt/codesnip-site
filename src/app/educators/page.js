                            Hi Teachers, Mentors, Lecturers and just anyone who wants to help teach others. 
                            We are excited you might be considering using Langbytes to help with you educating. 
                            Whether this be a fun starter, a recommendation to a student or the many other ways 
                            Langbytes can help. 
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-2">
                            Langbytes doesn&apos;t require a sign up or an active account to use so its perfect for students. 
                            Though it can be great with an account, especially for you educators, you can favourite 
                            problems you like! <span className="italic">Pretty cool if you ask me!</span> And you can 
                            make lists (WIP). This is great if you want to save a question for later to use in a lesson. 
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-2">
                            We think Langbytes would make a great lesson starter. Whether this be the daily challenge or a question you
                            saved earlier. The display of questions make them perfect for white boards or projector displays.
